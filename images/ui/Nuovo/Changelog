0.5 (Dec, 2005)

* lots of new icons, about 150...
  some highlights:
    MMC/SD and some other media formats like this
    improved floppy drive
    battery icon
    new filesystems, for block/char devs and sockets

* new emblems

* emblems now support translations, so you don't 
  have to guess what does a bad designed icon mean ;)
  
* new gaim icons, just like in 0.4, you'll need to
  replace some files.
  
* text in mimetypes now is bigger so you can read
  it without your glasses :P

0.4 (Oct 20, 2005)

* This release includes some PNG icons for evolution 
  stock icons. It seems that evolution isn't loading 
  ANY of the SVG stock icons, so   you can find the 
  PNGs in 24x24/stock/evolution those same icons are 
  available in scalable/stock for you to modify sorry 
  for choosing this way, but is the only one i've found 
  so far.
  
* stock icons for GNOME Baker in Xtra directory

* icons for iRiver devices IHP-120, IPF-880 and H10 to 
  replace 'gnome-dev-ipod'.

0.3 (Oct 4, 2005)

* 34 new icons, more emblems... 

* reworked many icons in every category (apps, 
  emblems, devices, filesystems, mimetypes, stock). 

0.2 (Date)

* many many new icons (by many i mean 133).

* like bvc suggested, i've used vacuum defs, so filesize 
  has decreased a lot.
